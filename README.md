# The LinkedIn Email Finder

### A node web scraper to extract your linkedin connection emails

![demo-part-1](https://github.com/aminblm/linkedin-email-finder/assets/25132838/4245d582-3599-4b98-a3c6-b06454c29921)


## Important Note
Scraping data off of LinkedIn is against their [User Agreement](https://www.linkedin.com/legal/user-agreement). This is purely intended for educational purposes.

## Why?
LinkedIn allows you to export all of your connections' info into a csv, except for their emails. 
Additionally their API stopped allowing the extraction of emails around 2013-2014. Why don't we have access to our connections emails through their data export if we both agreed to share that info/data?

## LinkedIn UI Versions

## Issues extracting? Read This

If linkedin updates their page and changes the class of an element used in the script it will stop working. You can check out the source code and verify if any class has changed on linkedin and update the script to make it work again. I can't be constantly checking linkedin to see if they have changed something that breaks the script.
